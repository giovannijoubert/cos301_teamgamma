\section{Organisation}
\subsection{ClickUP}
You need to elect a team leader if you have not done so already. Work together with this member to create tasks and sub-tasks for each member in your team on \url{http://clickup.com} (on the COS301 workspace you have been invited to). \\

Ensure that you indicate progress and mark tasks as complete. This page will be displayed at the demo.

\subsection{Slack}
